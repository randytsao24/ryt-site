          <h2 class='body-title'>Prioracle</h2>
          <p class='body-text'>
            Mobile app developed with fellow Fullstack Academy students. Prioracle utilizes machine learning and web scraping algorithms to analyze a product listing and determine a fair price to sell a product at. Frontend was developed with React-Native and deployed with Expo. Backend utilized the Koa HTTP framework and Sequelize for communicating with our Postgres database and was deployed with Heroku.

            Originally, Prioracle was the brainchild of Arnold Salas, a brilliant classmate of mine. As of February 2017, Arnold is finishing up his PhD in machine learning at the University of Oxford. The idea for Prioracle began when kaggle.io began a new data science competition sponsored by Mercari (the Japanese eBay, or so I've been told).

            Mercari is especially interested in generating accurate price points just by parsing the contents of a product listing. We thought, why not use such a feature to develop a standalone mobile app? Thanks to the datasets provided by Mercari -- over 1.5 million entries in the training data set -- Arnold was able to optimize and develop a machine learning algorithm with an error rate of 40% in less than a week.

            My role in this project was to mainly handle the frontend. We settled on React-Native mostly because of its cross-platform functionality -- it was particularly interesting to test simultaneously on a physical Android device and an iOS simulator. It was frustrating at first to be limited to inline CSS styling, but I got over it pretty quickly. Additionally, I made extensive use of the <a class='project-link' href='https://react-native-training.github.io/react-native-elements/'>React Native Elements</a> UI toolkit.
          </p>
          <p class='body-text'>
            Having some minor experience in Android app development, I found React-Native to be a bit clunky in comparison to native mobile development. But I have to admit that it's an awesome library, considering that you're writing code in JS that will be deployed to both iOS and Android platforms at the same time.
