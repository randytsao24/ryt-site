        <!-- TODO: Move this tl;dr stuff out of here -->
        <p class='body-text'>
          I'm Randy and I'm a junior software engineer. A native of Southern California, I moved to Brooklyn in August 2017 where I've been enjoying life ever since. Aside from software engineering, I like to pursue my hobbies (of which there may be too many). Some of my hobbies include listening to music, playing music, reading up on history and science, and traveling.
        </p>
        <p class='body-text'>
          As of mid-February 2018, I just graduated from Fullstack Academy of Code in NYC where I learned the ins-and-outs of contemporary web single page application design with a stack consisting of Node, React, Redux, Express, and Postgres.
         </p>
        <h2 class='body-title'>What can I do?</h2>
        <p class='body-text'>
          Some of the languages I am proficient/knowledgeable in include C, C++ (11 and 14), Java, JavaScript (ES6 and TypeScript), and Python. With Node.js, some of the frameworks I enjoy using are React, Redux, Express, Koa, and Sequelize.
        </p>
        <p class='body-text'>
          I like to make applications that don't beat you over the head with intense information overload. I'm mostly interested in providing a clean, soft user experience.
        </p>
        <h2 class='body-title'>About this site...</h2>
        <p class='body-text'>
          This site was developed entirely with basic HTML and CSS and deployed with Google App Engine. After graduating from Fullstack Academy, I realized that I hadn't constructed a simple webpage for fun ever since my foray into Node.js -- the last time might've been when Geocities was still around. So I thought to myself, why not?
